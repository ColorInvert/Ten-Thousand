How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

    Running game_logic.py in the ten_thousand folder will begin the game in your console.

Tests

    Tests are run through pytest, and v1 of this assignment came with a premade set of tests to pass before version one is considered complete.
    v2 required the ability to match the "simulations" provided in the version_2 folder. Counting the rounds, adding up score, calculating current hand, and the ability to quit at any time with q were all requirements of v2.
